# Black Car Cold Outbound

A 5-email sequence targeting black car and limo operators who are likely still using manual processes (spreadsheets, phone/email booking, paper dispatch). The sequence focuses on pain points around wasted time and lost revenue, positioning Moovs as the modern alternative.

## Entry Criteria

- Black car / limousine operator
- Fleet size 5-50 vehicles
- No known existing transportation software (or using legacy system)
- Has email address (owner or operations manager)

## Exit Criteria

- Replies to any email (positive or negative)
- Books a demo
- Unsubscribes
- Completes sequence without engagement

## Timing

| Email | Day | Subject | Goal |
|-------|-----|---------|------|
| 1 | 0 | "Question about [Company]" | Open conversation |
| 2 | 3 | "The spreadsheet problem" | Relate to pain |
| 3 | 7 | "How [Similar Company] cut admin time in half" | Social proof |
| 4 | 12 | "15 minutes this week?" | Direct ask |
| 5 | 18 | "Closing the loop" | Final attempt |

## Notes

- Personalize Email 1 with company name and any specific detail you noticed
- Email 3 can swap the case study based on what's most relevant
- Day 12 and 18 can flex based on response rates
