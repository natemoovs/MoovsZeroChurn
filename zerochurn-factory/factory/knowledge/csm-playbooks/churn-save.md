# Churn Save Playbook

When a customer is actively leaving or seriously at-risk, these plays give you the best chance to save them. Speed matters — every day of delay reduces save probability.

---

## Save Goals

1. **Understand** — Why are they really leaving?
2. **Address** — Can we fix the root cause?
3. **Retain** — Get commitment to stay
4. **Rebuild** — Prevent future risk

---

**Response:** Proactive outreach, discovery call

### Level 2: Active Churn Process (Act Within 48 Hours)

---

## Save Call Framework

### Before the Call

**Prepare:**
1. Full account history (usage, support, feedback)
2. Value delivered (metrics, wins)
3. Known issues/complaints
4. Potential concession options
5. Similar customers who've stayed

**Mindset:**
- Curious, not defensive
- Focused on their needs, not our retention
- Prepared to lose if it's right for them
- But fight hard if we can genuinely help

### The Save Call Structure

**1. Open with Acknowledgment (2 min)**

> "I understand you're thinking about leaving Moovs. Before we talk about that, I want to understand what's going on. You've been a great customer, and if we've let you down, I want to know."

**2. Deep Discovery (15 min)**

**Goal:** Understand the real reason (not the stated reason)

**Questions:**
- "What's driving this decision?"
- "When did you start feeling this way?"
- "What would need to be different for you to stay?"
- "If we could fix [issue], would that change things?"
- "Is this about us, or about changes in your business?"

**Listen for:**
- Root cause (product, price, service, fit, business change)
- Emotional state (frustrated, resigned, conflicted)
- Decision firmness (exploring vs. decided)
- Decision maker (are they the one deciding?)

**3. Address the Root Cause (10 min)**

Based on what you learn:

| Root Cause | Response |
|------------|----------|
| Product gap | Workaround, roadmap, escalate to product |
| Service failure | Apologize, commit to fix, escalate internally |
| Price | ROI review, term adjustment, discount (last resort) |
| Champion left | Rebuild relationship with new stakeholder |
| Business change | Understand if fit still exists |
| Competitor offer | Differentiate, match if warranted |
| Never got value | Diagnose why, offer restart |

**4. Present Your Case (5 min)**

If there's a path to save:

> "Based on what you've shared, here's what I can do: [specific actions]. If we do this, does that address your concerns enough to stay?"

**Be specific:**
- This is what we'll fix and by when
- This is the concession we can offer
- This is who will be involved
- This is how I'll follow up

**5. Get Commitment or Learn (5 min)**

**If they'll stay:**
> "Great. Let me confirm: if we [actions], you'll commit to staying through [timeframe]. Can I get that in writing?"

**If they won't:**
> "I respect your decision. Before we wrap up, can you share what we could have done differently? I want to learn from this."

## Concession Options

Use strategically — don't give away the store.

### Low-Cost Concessions (Offer First)

| Concession | When to Offer |
|------------|---------------|
| Additional training | Adoption issues |
| Feature setup help | Not using key features |
| Success check-ins (more frequent) | Feeling neglected |
| Direct escalation path | Support frustration |
| Beta access to new feature | Feature gap |

### Medium-Cost Concessions (Require Approval)

| Concession | When to Offer |
|------------|---------------|
| Free months (1-2) | Bridge to fix issue |
| Tier upgrade (temporary) | Feature need |
| Contract flexibility (month-to-month) | Commitment concerns |
| Dedicated support | High-touch need |

### High-Cost Concessions (Leadership Approval)

| Concession | When to Offer |
|------------|---------------|
| Significant discount (15%+) | Price is real blocker |
| Multi-month credit | Major service failure |
| Custom development | Product gap for large customer |
| Executive involvement | Relationship repair |

### Concession Principles

1. **Get something in return** — Commitment, longer term, case study
2. **Time-bound** — Not forever, review in 6 months
3. **Address root cause** — Don't discount your way past a product problem
4. **Document** — What was given and why

## Save Scenarios

### Scenario: Competitor Offer

**Their statement:** "We're looking at [Competitor]. They have [feature] and cost less."

**Response:**
1. Don't trash the competitor
2. Ask what specifically appeals to them
3. Differentiate on what matters (not everything)
4. Highlight switching costs honestly
5. Match price only if necessary and justified

**Say:**
> "I know [Competitor] — they're solid in [area]. Can you tell me what specifically you'd get there that you're not getting here? I want to understand the gap."

> "One thing to consider: you've got [X months of data, trained team, integrations]. That takes time to rebuild. Is the difference worth that cost?"

### Scenario: Budget Cuts

**Their statement:** "We're cutting costs and can't afford Moovs anymore."

**Response:**
1. Express understanding
2. Review ROI (their savings from Moovs)
3. Explore downgrade options
4. Offer pause instead of cancel (if available)

**Say:**
> "I understand — budget pressure is real. Before we talk about canceling, can we look at what Moovs saves you? If the ROI is still positive, it might be the wrong thing to cut."

> "Would it help to move to a lower tier temporarily? Or could we pause for a quarter and revisit?"

### Scenario: Never Got Value

**Their statement:** "We just haven't been using it. It's not working for us."

**Response:**
1. Acknowledge without defending
2. Understand why (onboarding issue, wrong fit, complexity)
3. Offer restart with better support
4. If wrong fit, let them go gracefully

**Say:**
> "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you help me understand what happened? Was it the product, the onboarding, or something else?"

> "If you're open to it, I'd like to offer a restart with dedicated support. We'd essentially re-onboard you with more hands-on help. Would that make a difference?"

### Scenario: Champion Left

**Their statement:** "Sarah left and the new person wants to use something else."

**Response:**
1. Build relationship with new person fast
2. Don't assume the decision is final
3. Offer training/onboarding for new stakeholder
4. Show value delivered (data speaks)

**Say:**
> "I'd love to meet [New Person] and understand their perspective. Sometimes a fresh set of eyes sees things differently. Can you connect us?"

> "I've also pulled together what you've accomplished with Moovs this year: [metrics]. It might be helpful for [New Person] to see that context."

### Scenario: Unresolved Issue

**Their statement:** "We've been complaining about [issue] for months and nothing happened."

**Response:**
1. Own it — don't make excuses
2. Apologize sincerely
3. Commit to specific resolution
4. Involve leadership if needed

**Say:**
> "You're right, and I'm sorry. We dropped the ball on [issue]. That's not okay. Here's what I'm committing to: [specific fix, timeline, owner]. If we don't deliver, I'll understand if you leave. But I'm asking for one more chance."
