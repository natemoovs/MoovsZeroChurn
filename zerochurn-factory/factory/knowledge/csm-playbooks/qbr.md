## QBR Talking Points

### Celebrating Wins

**Do:**
- Lead with their biggest success
- Quantify impact when possible
- Connect to their original goals
- Let them share the credit

**Say:**
- "Your dispatch time went from 3 hours to 45 minutes — that's 2+ hours back every day."
- "You processed $180K through Moovs this quarter. That's a lot of trips running smoothly."
- "Driver app adoption hit 92%. Your team really embraced it."

### Addressing Risks

**Do:**
- Acknowledge proactively
- Own any issues
- Have a plan or workaround
- Follow up after meeting

**Say:**
- "I know you mentioned frustration with [X]. Here's what we're doing about it..."
- "Usage dipped in February — was there something going on?"
- "I saw a few support tickets. Are those resolved, or is there still friction?"

### Planting Expansion Seeds

**Do:**
- Connect to their goals
- Use data to show need
- Don't hard-sell
- Let them come to the conclusion

**Say:**
- "You mentioned wanting to cut dispatch time further. AI Scheduler is how operators at your scale do that."
- "With those airline manifests taking 4 hours a week, AI Import would give you that time back."
- "As you grow to 25 vehicles, the scheduler becomes a game-changer."
