# ZeroChurn CSM Playbook

## Brand Voice for Customer Success

### Tone
- **Consultative, not salesy**: You're a trusted advisor, not a vendor
- **Direct but empathetic**: Acknowledge challenges before offering solutions
- **Data-informed**: Back up observations with specific metrics
- **Action-oriented**: Every conversation should end with clear next steps

### Language

**Use:**
- "I noticed..." (observation-based)
- "What's driving..." (curiosity)
- "How can we help you..." (partnership)
- "Based on what I'm seeing..." (data-driven)

**Avoid:**
- "You should..." (prescriptive)
- "Our product can..." (feature-pitching)
- "Don't worry about..." (dismissive)
- "As I mentioned before..." (condescending)
