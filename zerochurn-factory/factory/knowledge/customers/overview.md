## Universal CSM Principles

### 1. Revenue Determines Segment

If an operator has 8 vehicles but only $180K revenue → SMB treatment
If an operator has 15 coaches but $1.5M revenue → Enterprise treatment

### 2. Success = Growth + Adoption

Healthy customers do both:
- **Growth:** More vehicles, more trips, more revenue through Moovs
- **Adoption:** Using more features, higher engagement, referrals

### 3. Churn is a Process, Not an Event

Warning signs appear months before cancellation:
- Usage decline
- Champion change
- Feature requests ignored
- Competitor mentions
- Engagement drop

### 4. Expansion is Earned

Don't push upgrades. Earn them by:
- Proving value with current plan
- Connecting expansion to their goals
- Timing with business triggers
