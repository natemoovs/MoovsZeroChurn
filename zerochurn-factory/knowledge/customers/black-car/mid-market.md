## Segment Definition

### What Mid-Market Black Car Means

Mid-Market Black Car operators are established, growing transportation businesses generating $250K-$1M in annual revenue, typically running fleets of 6-19 vehicles with dedicated operational staff. Unlike SMB owner-operators, they have a management structure. Unlike Enterprise operators, they're more nimble and cost-conscious.

**Revenue Profile:**
- Annual Revenue: $250K-$1M (primary indicator)
- Fleet Size: Typically 6-19 vehicles (but revenue matters more)
- Business Stage: Proven model, actively scaling
- Operator Type: Owner + management team

**Key Principle:** Revenue is the primary segmentation indicator. An operator with 15 coaches generating $1.5M is Enterprise. An operator with 22 sedans generating $800K is Mid-Market.

**Service Types:**
- Primarily black car services (sedans, SUVs) - 65%
- Limousine and bus services - 20%
- Corporate accounts and airport transfers
- Individual high-value customers (loyal clientele)
- Special events and charters

**Critical Distinction:** Customers book and pay for the ENTIRE vehicle (not per-seat). This is fundamentally different from shuttle operations.

### Company Size & Scale

**Revenue (Primary Indicator):**
- Minimum: $250K annually
- Sweet Spot: $500K annually

- Threshold: Above $1M typically transitions to Enterprise
- Rule: If revenue conflicts with fleet size, revenue determines segment

**Fleet Size (Supporting Indicator):**
- Minimum: 6 vehicles
- Sweet Spot: 10 vehicles
- Maximum: 19 vehicles
- Note: 15 coaches at $1.5M revenue → Enterprise (revenue trumps fleet)

**Staff Structure:**
- Owner/Manager: Active in business but not doing everything
- Operations: 1-2 dedicated dispatchers/operations managers
- Sales: 1 sales person (owner may also sell)
- Drivers: 10-25 employed drivers

- Administration: Owner or office manager handles accounting/admin

### Geographic & Market Characteristics

- Primary: Single location (one office/dispatch center)
- Market Type: Urban or suburban markets (or both)
- Service Area: Local/regional (typically 50-100 mile radius)
- Expansion Aspirations: May want to add locations eventually

**Market Position:**
- Established local presence (typically 3-5+ years in business)
- Known in their market (local reputation matters)
- Compete with both larger and smaller operators
- Not the cheapest option, not the most expensive

### Moovs Product Usage (Current Customers)

## Technographic Profile

### Current Technology Stack

**Dispatch & Operations:**
- Common tools: Basic dispatch software (often SMB-tier tools they've outgrown)
- Pain: Legacy systems like FASTTRAK, basic Limo Anywhere, or spreadsheets
- Problem: Current tools don't scale with their growth
- Gap: Need automation and efficiency they don't have

**Booking & Customer-Facing:**
- Phone and email primary channels
- Basic website (may have online booking, but often clunky)
- Manual quote creation and follow-up
- No automated customer communication

**Operations & Management:**
- Manual driver assignment
- Spreadsheet-based scheduling
- Basic or no fleet tracking
- Limited reporting and analytics

### Technology Needs & Readiness

**Must-Have Capabilities:**
1. Efficient dispatch (reduce manual work)
2. Professional customer-facing tools (look established)
3. Reporting and analytics (understand business performance)
4. Customer relationship management (retain and grow accounts)
5. Automated communication (save time, improve service)

**Technology Posture:**
- Adoption Readiness: Medium-high (willing to learn if they see value)
- Tech Sophistication: Basic to intermediate
- Implementation Preference: Guided/assisted (need some hand-holding)
- Budget Consciousness: Want value, not necessarily cheapest option

## Pain Points & Problems

### 1. Outgrowing Current Tools (Primary Pain)

- **Pain:** Current dispatch system worked when smaller but can't keep up now
- **Impact:** Operational inefficiency, errors, lost productivity as they grow
- **Language:** "When I had 3 cars, spreadsheets worked fine. Now with 10 cars and 2 dispatchers, we're drowning in chaos."
- **Trigger:** Just hired second dispatcher or hitting 8-10 vehicles

### 2. Manual Processes Killing Efficiency

- **Pain:** Manual driver assignment, quotes, follow-ups consume hours daily
- **Impact:** Can't grow revenue because team is buried in manual work
- **Language:** "My dispatcher spends 3 hours a day just assigning trips. That's time we could use to bring in more business."
- **Urgency:** High - at the inflection point where inefficiency limits growth

### 3. Lack of Professionalism in Customer Experience

- **Pain:** Customers expect professional experience (online booking, automated confirmations, real-time updates)
- **Impact:** Losing business to competitors with better customer-facing technology
- **Language:** "Corporate clients are used to booking car services online. When we tell them to call or email, we look outdated."

### 4. No Visibility into Business Performance

- **Pain:** Don't have clear reporting on revenue, driver performance, customer trends
- **Impact:** Making business decisions based on gut feel, not data
- **Language:** "I have no idea which customers are most profitable or which drivers are most efficient. I'm flying blind."
- **Growth Blocker:** Can't optimize or scale without understanding what's working

### 5. Can't Track or Improve Customer Loyalty

- **Pain:** No system to track repeat customers, identify VIPs, or nurture relationships
- **Impact:** Revenue leakage - not maximizing value from existing clients
- **Language:** "I know we have repeat customers, but I don't know who they are or how often they book. We're missing upsell opportunities."

### 6. Disconnected Systems Create Data Entry Hell

- **Pain:** Enter trip info in dispatch, re-enter in accounting, re-enter for driver
- **Impact:** Wasted time, data entry errors, frustration
- **Language:** "We're entering the same trip information 3 different times. It's maddening."

### 7. Driver Coordination and Utilization

- **Pain:** Hard to know which drivers are available, where they are, optimal assignments
- **Impact:** Underutilizing drivers or poor assignments
- **Language:** "I have 15 drivers but no good way to know who's available or closest to the pickup."

### 8. Can't Compete with Larger Operators on Features

- **Pain:** Enterprise operators have sophisticated dispatch, real-time tracking, professional portals
- **Impact:** Losing corporate accounts to bigger competitors
- **Language:** "Corporate clients are asking for features we don't have. If we don't modernize, we'll lose them."

### 9. Growth is Constrained by Operational Capacity

- **Pain:** Could take on more business but operations can't handle current volume efficiently
- **Impact:** Turning down business or poor service quality during growth
- **Language:** "I could double our revenue if my operations could keep up. Right now, adding more trips just breaks everything."

### 10. Pricing and Profitability Challenges

- **Pain:** Manual quoting is slow; hard to know if pricing is competitive and profitable
- **Impact:** Leaving money on table or losing bids
- **Language:** "By the time I get a quote back to a customer, they've already booked with someone else."

## Buying Process & Decision Criteria

### Buying Committee

**Primary Decision Maker:**
- Role: Owner or General Manager
- Concerns: ROI, growth enablement, operational efficiency
- Authority: Final decision maker
- Mindset: "Will this help me grow to 20+ vehicles?"

**Key Influencers:**
- Dispatcher/Operations Manager: Daily user, must be easy enough for them
- Sales Person: Needs tools to quote faster and track customers
- Office Manager/Admin: Handles billing and reporting
- Drivers: Not typically involved in decision, but adoption matters

**Unique Dynamic:** Decision is usually owner-led with input from ops manager. Less committee-driven than Enterprise, but not purely owner impulse like SMB.

### Typical Buying Triggers

**Operational Triggers:**
- Just hired (or about to hire) second dispatcher
- Hit 8-10 vehicles and current system breaking down
- Lost a key corporate account due to lack of features
- Dispatcher threatening to quit due to manual chaos

**Growth Triggers:**
- Trying to add 3-5 more vehicles in next 12 months

- Expanding to adjacent market or city
- Hiring first sales person (need CRM and better tools)

**Competitive Triggers:**
- Competitor winning business due to better technology
- Corporate client asking for features they don't have
- Losing individual customers to operators with online booking

### Decision Criteria (Ranked by Importance)

1. **Growth Enablement (Highest Priority)**
   - "Will this help me scale from 10 to 15-20 vehicles?"
   - "Can this support growth without breaking?"
   - "Will efficiency gains free up time to grow?"

2. **Operational Efficiency**
   - "Will this reduce manual work for my dispatchers?"
   - "How much time will this save daily?"
   - "Can I handle more trips with same team?"

3. **Professional Customer Experience**
   - "Will this make us look more professional?"
   - "Can customers book online easily?"
   - "Do we get automated confirmations and reminders?"

4. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - "Will I finally understand my business performance?"
   - "Can I see which customers/drivers are most profitable?"

5. **Affordability & ROI**
   - "Can I afford this at current revenue?"
   - "What's the payback period?"

6. **Ease of Use & Adoption**
   - "Can my dispatcher learn this quickly?"
   - "Will my drivers actually use the app?"

7. **Implementation & Support**
   - "How long until we're live?"
   - "Will I get help setting this up?"

8. **Scalability**
   - "What happens when I grow to 20 vehicles?"
   - "Will I have to switch platforms again?"

### Sales Cycle Characteristics

**Cycle Length:** 45 days (6-7 weeks)

**Typical Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Discovery and initial demo
- Week 3-4: Internal evaluation and stakeholder input
- Week 5-6: Negotiation and decision
- Week 7: Contract signing and setup
- Implementation: 2-3 weeks

**Sales Motion:** Sales-assisted
- Not self-serve (need guidance and consultation)
- Not high-touch Enterprise (faster, simpler process)
- Mid-touch: demos, proposals, some negotiation
- Need clear ROI and value justification

### Budget Authority & Deal Size

**Budget Range:**
- Annual Software Budget: $3,000-$6,000 ($250-$500/month)
- Sweet Spot: $300-$400/month (Pro plan range)
- Decision Threshold: Owner can typically approve up to $500/month

**ROI Calculation They Care About:**
- Time saved per dispatcher per day (hours × $20-30/hour)
- Additional trips handled without adding staff
- Revenue from corporate accounts won (enabled by features)
- Cost of current tools being replaced
- Payback period target: 6-12 months

---

## Disqualifiers (DO NOT PURSUE)

**Hard Disqualifiers:**
- Revenue under $250K (SMB segment)
- Revenue over $1M (Enterprise segment)
- No plan to grow (maintenance mode operators)
- Owner wants DIY/build-it-themselves solution
- Primarily farm-in/affiliate work (no direct customers)
- Already using Enterprise-grade platform happily
- Zero budget or extreme price sensitivity
- Shuttle or per-seat operators (wrong segment)

**Edge Cases - When to Qualify as Mid-Market:**
- 15 coaches, $4M revenue → Enterprise (revenue trumps fleet)
- 22 sedans, $1M revenue → Mid-Market (revenue determines)
- 8 vehicles, $2M revenue → Mid-Market (high revenue per vehicle)

**Rule:** If annual revenue is $250K-$1M, they're Mid-Market regardless of fleet size.

## GTM Motion

### Primary Approach

**Sales-Assisted Motion:**
- Not self-serve (need consultation and guidance)
- Not high-touch Enterprise (faster, simpler process)
- Mid-touch: Demo-driven, proposal, clear ROI, modest negotiation
- Goal: Make decision easy with clear value and reasonable effort

**Sales Process:**
1. Discovery call (20-30 min): Understand current state, pain points, growth goals
2. Demo (30-45 min): Show key workflows (dispatch, customer booking, reporting)
3. Proposal (1-2 days): Clear pricing, ROI calculation, implementation plan
4. Decision (1-2 weeks): Owner evaluates, gets ops manager input
5. Close & onboard (1 week): Contract, setup, training

### Marketing Channels

**Digital:**
- Google Ads (search: "dispatch software for 10 vehicle fleet")
- LinkedIn targeting (transportation company owners, 10-25 employees)
- Industry publications and blogs
- Webinars on scaling operations

**Events:**
- Regional transportation conferences
- Local chamber events
- Industry meetups

**Referrals:**
- Current mid-market customers (strongest channel)
- SMB customers graduating to mid-market
- Industry peer networks

### Typical Objections & Responses

**"Our current system works fine for now."**
> "When we talk to operators at your stage, they say the same thing—until they try to grow. What happens when you want to add 5 more vehicles? Your current system will break. Let's plan for that now, not in a crisis."

**"This seems expensive for our size."**
> "Let's do the math. If this saves your dispatcher 2 hours per day, that's $15K-20K annually. Plus you can handle 30% more trips without hiring more staff. What's the payback period on that?"

**"We're not big enough for this."**
> "Actually, this is built specifically for operators at your stage—growing from 6-15 vehicles. SMB tools won't scale with you, and Enterprise platforms are overkill. This is the sweet spot."

**"My dispatcher won't learn a new system."**
> "Operators tell us their dispatchers learn Moovs in 2-3 days, and within a week they're faster than the old system. Plus we provide hands-on training and support."

**"What if we outgrow this?"**
> "Moovs scales from 6 vehicles to 50+ vehicles. When you hit 15-20 vehicles, you'll just upgrade to Pro features. You won't need to switch platforms again."
