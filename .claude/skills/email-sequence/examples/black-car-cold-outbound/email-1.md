Hi [First Name],

Quick question - is your team still handling reservations through phone calls and email?

I ask because most limo operators I talk to are spending 2-3 hours a day on booking admin that could be automated. Confirmations, reminders, driver assignments, payment collection - all manual.

If that sounds familiar, I'd love to show you how operators like [Similar Company in their market] have cut that time in half.

Worth a 15-minute call?

[Your name]
