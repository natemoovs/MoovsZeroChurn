[First Name],

Spreadsheets work great for tracking trips - until you have two people updating the same sheet, or a driver calls asking about a trip that got deleted, or you need to pull a report for a corporate client.

Every operator hits that wall eventually. The question is whether you keep patching the spreadsheet or move to something built for this.

Not pitching you on a call yet - genuinely curious: what's your biggest headache with how you manage trips today?

[Your name]
