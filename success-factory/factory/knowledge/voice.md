# Moovs Voice for Customer Success

This guide extends our brand voice guidelines for Customer Success communications. Same Moovs tone — confident, helpful, industry-savvy — applied to customer retention and expansion.

---

## Core Voice Principles

### We Are: A Knowledgeable Peer

We speak as someone who deeply understands ground transportation operations AND the customer's journey with Moovs. Not as a tech company talking down to operators, and not as a generic CSM reading scripts.

**Do:** "I noticed your driver acceptance rate dropped this month. Let's look at what changed."
**Don't:** "Our metrics indicate a suboptimal driver engagement pattern requiring intervention."

### Voice Characteristics (Same as Brand)

- **Straightforward**: Say what you mean. No corporate fluff.
- **Confident but humble**: Expert on the platform, learning about their business.
- **Helpful, not salesy**: Solve problems, don't push upgrades without value.
- **Conversational**: Like a trusted business advisor, not a support bot.

## CSM-Specific Tone Adjustments

### With Existing Customers vs. Prospects

| Context      | Prospect (Sales)           | Customer (CSM)         |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Relationship | Proving value              | Delivering value       |
| Knowledge    | Learning their business    | Know their history     |
| Tone         | Enthusiastic, aspirational | Practical, partnership |
| Focus        | What Moovs could do        | What Moovs is doing    |
| Proof        | Case studies, features     | Their own data, wins   |

### Example Comparison

**Sales email:**

> "Moovs helps operators like you save 10+ hours per week on dispatch. Let's schedule a demo to show you how."

**CSM email:**

> "Looking at your account, you've cut dispatch time from 4 hours to 45 minutes since onboarding. Nice work. Let's talk about doing the same for your billing workflow."

## Tone by Situation

### Check-in Calls (Routine)

**Tone:** Warm, efficient, curious

- Start with genuine interest in their business
- Acknowledge their time is valuable
- Focus on what matters to them
- Leave with clear next steps

**Do:** "How's the busy season treating you? I saw you added two vehicles last month — congrats!"
**Don't:** "I'm calling to conduct your monthly success check-in as per our engagement cadence."

### QBRs (Quarterly Business Reviews)

**Tone:** Strategic, data-driven, forward-looking

- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Connect platform usage to business results
- Propose next steps tied to their goals
- Be honest about areas to improve

**Do:** "Your renewal rate improved 12% since you started using automated reminders. If we add flight tracking, we could reduce those airport no-shows."
**Don't:** "Feature X has a 94% satisfaction rate and we recommend you adopt it."

### Renewals

**Tone:** Confident, value-focused, collaborative

- Celebrate the partnership
- Quantify value delivered
- Address concerns proactively
- Make renewal feel natural, not transactional

**Do:** "You've processed $180K through Moovs this year with zero payment disputes. Let's lock in the same rate for next year."
**Don't:** "Your contract expires in 30 days. Please sign the attached renewal agreement."

### Escalations / Save Calls

**Tone:** Empathetic, accountable, solution-oriented

- Acknowledge the problem directly
- Take ownership (even if not our fault)
- Focus on fixing, not defending
- Follow up until resolved

**Do:** "I understand the API issue cost you a corporate booking. That's on us to fix. Here's what we're doing and when it'll be resolved."
**Don't:** "The issue you experienced is actually related to a third-party integration that falls outside our service scope."

### Delivering Bad News

**Tone:** Direct, empathetic, forward-focused

- Say it clearly upfront
- Explain why (briefly)
- Pivot to solution or next steps
- Don't over-apologize or blame

**Do:** "The feature you requested won't make it into Q2. Here's a workaround that might help, and I'll flag you when it's back on the roadmap."
**Don't:** "Unfortunately, due to competing priorities and resource constraints, we've had to make the difficult decision to defer your feature request indefinitely."

## Language for Common CSM Scenarios

### Celebrating Wins

**Good:**

- "You hit 500 bookings this month — first time since launch!"
- "Your drivers are accepting trips 40% faster than last quarter."
- "That corporate account you landed is already your #3 by revenue."

**Avoid:**

- "Congratulations on your continued platform engagement."
- "Your KPIs show positive directional indicators."

### Addressing Problems

**Good:**

- "I noticed payment failures spiked last week. Let's fix that."
- "Usage dropped 30% — is everything okay with the team?"
- "You mentioned frustration with quoting. Show me what's happening."

**Avoid:**

- "Our monitoring systems detected an anomaly in your account metrics."
- "Are you experiencing any challenges with our platform?"

### Suggesting Upsells/Expansions

**Good:**

- "You're manually importing manifests weekly. AI Import could save you 2 hours per batch."
- "With 25 vehicles now, the AI Scheduler would prevent the double-bookings you mentioned."
- "Your corporate clients are asking for reports — Insights gives you that with one click."

**Avoid:**

- "I'd like to discuss upgrading your subscription tier."
- "Our premium features could enhance your operational efficiency."

### Handling Churn Risk

**Good:**

- "I saw you're evaluating other options. What's driving that? Let's talk."
- "You've been quieter lately. Is Moovs still solving the problems you came for?"
- "If there's something we could do differently, I want to know."

**Avoid:**

- "We value your business and would hate to see you go."
- "Our retention team would like to discuss your concerns."

## Writing Guidelines for CSM

### 1. Lead with Their Data, Not Our Platform

**Do:** "Your dispatch time dropped from 3 hours to 40 minutes."
**Don't:** "Our platform's dispatch efficiency features are best-in-class."

### 2. Speak to Their Business, Not Our Product

**Do:** "That airport account is bringing in $12K/month now."
**Don't:** "Your utilization of our airport transfer module has increased."

### 3. Be Specific, Not Generic

**Do:** "Your payment collection is 8 days faster than the average operator."
**Don't:** "Moovs helps operators collect payments faster."

### 4. Acknowledge Industry Reality

**Do:** "Wedding season's coming — let's make sure your quoting is ready."
**Don't:** "Q2 represents an opportunity for increased transaction volume."

### 5. Match Their Communication Style

- If they're brief: Be brief
- If they're detailed: Match the depth
- If they prefer calls: Call
- If they live in email: Email

## Email Templates: Good vs. Bad

### Check-in Email

**Bad:**

> Subject: Monthly Success Check-in
>
> Dear [Customer],
>
> I hope this email finds you well. As part of our customer success engagement program, I am reaching out to conduct your monthly check-in. Please let me know your availability for a 30-minute call this week.
>
> Best regards

**Good:**

> Subject: Quick sync on Q1 — 15 min?
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> Noticed you added two new vehicles last month — nice growth. Also saw dispatch time is up a bit. Want to jump on a quick call to see if there's anything we can tune?
>
> Free Thursday afternoon?

### Risk Outreach

**Bad:**

> Subject: We Value Your Partnership
>
> Dear [Customer],
>
> Our records indicate that your platform engagement has decreased over the past 30 days. We value your partnership and would like to schedule a call to discuss how we can better serve your needs.

**Good:**

> Subject: Everything okay?
>
> Hey [Name],
>
> Your team hasn't logged in much lately — wanted to check in. Did something change, or is there a problem we should know about?
>
> Happy to jump on a call if useful.

## Industry Vocabulary (Same as Brand)

Use operator language, not SaaS jargon:

| Say This                | Not This                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Trip, ride, reservation | Journey, booking instance |
| Passenger, rider        | End user, customer        |
| Driver                  | Resource, asset           |
| Dispatch                | Operations management     |
| Farm out                | Outsource, subcontract    |
| Fleet                   | Vehicle assets            |
| Corporate account       | Enterprise client         |
| Busy season             | High-volume period        |

---

## Key Reminders

1. **You know their history** — reference it
2. **Their time is valuable** — be efficient
3. **Their business is their life** — respect it
4. **Problems are opportunities** — to prove value
5. **Renewals are earned** — not assumed
