# Escalation Playbook

When things go wrong, how you respond defines the relationship. Great escalation handling creates loyalty. Poor handling accelerates churn.

## Escalation Types

### Severity Levels

| Level        | Definition                                        | Response Time | Who's Involved                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | System down, major data loss, blocking operations | 1 hour        | CSM + Support Lead + Engineering |
| **High**     | Significant feature broken, workaround difficult  | 4 hours       | CSM + Support                    |
| **Medium**   | Feature issue with workaround                     | 24 hours      | CSM or Support                   |
| **Low**      | Minor inconvenience                               | 48 hours      | Support                          |

### Common Escalation Triggers

**Technical:**

- Platform down or slow

- Feature not working as expected

**Business:**

- Billing dispute

- SLA breach

**Relationship:**

## Escalation Response Framework

### Step 1: Acknowledge (Within 1 Hour)

**Goal:** Customer knows you're on it

**Actions:**

1. Acknowledge the issue
2. Show understanding of impact
3. Commit to next steps
4. Set expectation for follow-up

**Say:**

> "I just got your message about [issue]. I understand this is blocking [specific impact]. I'm escalating this internally right now and will have an update for you by [time]."

**Don't say:**

- "I'll look into it" (too vague)
- "That shouldn't happen" (irrelevant)
- "Let me check with the team" (without timeline)

### Step 2: Investigate (Time Based on Severity)

**Actions:**

1. Gather full context from customer
2. Pull internal data/logs
3. Identify root cause or path to root cause
4. Determine if workaround exists
5. Estimate resolution timeline

**Ask the customer:**

- "When did this start?"
- "What were you doing when it happened?"
- "Is there a workaround you're using?"
- "What's the business impact?"

### Step 3: Communicate (Based on Severity Timeline)

**Actions:**

1. Share what you know
2. Be honest about unknowns
3. Provide workaround if available
4. Set next update expectation

**Template:**

> "Here's what we know: [explanation]. We're still investigating [unknown]. In the meantime, you can [workaround] to keep moving. I'll update you again by [time]."

### Step 4: Resolve

**Actions:**

1. Implement fix or permanent workaround
2. Confirm with customer it's resolved
3. Document what happened
4. Identify prevention steps

### Step 5: Follow Up (24-48 Hours After Resolution)

**Actions:**

1. Check that everything is stable
2. Apologize sincerely (once)
3. Share prevention measures
4. Rebuild confidence

**Say:**

> "Wanted to check in — is everything working as expected since [fix]? I also wanted to share what we're doing to prevent this: [prevention]. I'm sorry this happened. Let me know if there's anything else."

## Internal Escalation Path

### When to Escalate Internally

| Trigger                     | Escalate To                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Can't resolve in 24 hours   | CSM Manager                |
| Customer executive involved | VP CS                      |
| Churn threat                | VP CS + Exec Sponsor       |
| Engineering required        | Support Lead → Engineering |
| Billing/Contract            | Finance + Legal if needed  |
| Product gap causing issue   | Product team               |

## Difficult Escalation Scenarios

### Scenario: It's Our Fault

**Approach:** Own it, fix it, prevent it

**Do:**

- Apologize sincerely (once, not repeatedly)
- Focus on resolution
- Share prevention steps
- Consider goodwill gesture if severe

**Say:**

> "This was our mistake. I'm sorry. Here's what we're doing to fix it and make sure it doesn't happen again."

### Scenario: It's Not Our Fault

**Approach:** Helpful, not defensive

**Do:**

- Acknowledge their frustration
- Explain gently
- Help find solution anyway
- Don't throw others under the bus

**Say:**

> "I understand the frustration. What happened is [explanation]. While it's not something we control, let me help you figure out next steps."

### Scenario: We Can't Fix It (Product Limitation)

**Approach:** Honest, alternative-focused

**Do:**

- Be transparent about limitation
- Offer workaround if possible
- Log as product feedback
- Set expectation about roadmap

**Say:**

> "You're right — we don't have that capability today. Here's a workaround that might help: [option]. I'm logging this as feedback for our product team."

### Scenario: Customer Is Very Angry

**Approach:** Calm, empathetic, action-focused

**Do:**

- Let them vent (briefly)
- Acknowledge emotion
- Focus on resolution
- Follow up in writing

**Say:**

> "I hear you, and I would be frustrated too. Let's focus on getting this fixed. Here's what I'm doing right now..."

**Don't:**

- Get defensive
- Argue facts while they're emotional
- Make promises you can't keep
- Disappear

## Escalation Metrics

Track these to improve:

| Metric                                | Target          | Why                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Time to Acknowledge                   | <1 hour         | Shows responsiveness      |
| Time to Resolution                    | By severity SLA | Measures effectiveness    |
| Customer Satisfaction Post-Escalation | >7/10           | Measures recovery         |
| Escalation → Churn Rate               | <5%             | Measures retention impact |
