# Renewal Playbook

Renewals should be formalities, not negotiations. If you've done the work throughout the year, renewal is just paperwork.

---

## Renewal Goals

1. **Retain the customer** — Minimum viable outcome
2. **Expand the contract** — Grow revenue
3. **Secure multi-year** — Reduce churn risk
4. **Strengthen relationship** — Deeper partnership

## Renewal Conversation Framework

### Opening (2 min)

**Goal:** Set positive tone, understand their state

**Say:**

- "Before we talk renewal, how's the business? What's on your mind?"
- "I want to make sure we cover anything you need before we talk next year."

### Value Review (10 min)

**Goal:** Remind them why they stay

**Cover:**

- Key metrics (trips, revenue, time savings)
- Wins from the year
- Problems solved
- Comparison to before Moovs

**Say:**

- "Let me walk through what you accomplished this year..."
- "When you started, dispatch took 4 hours. Now it's 45 minutes."
- "You processed $400K through the platform — that's a lot of smooth trips."

### Concerns (10 min)

**Goal:** Address objections before they're raised

**Ask:**

- "Is there anything that frustrated you this year?"
- "Any features you wished worked differently?"
- "What would make next year even better?"

**Handle:**

- Acknowledge concerns genuinely
- Provide plan to address (if fixable)
- Set expectations (if not fixable)
- Don't be defensive

### Next Year (10 min)

**Goal:** Connect renewal to their goals

**Ask:**

- "What's your focus for next year?"
- "Planning to grow the fleet?"
- "Any new markets or services?"

**Connect:**

- "Moovs scales with that — here's how..."
- "That's actually a great use case for [feature/upsell]..."
- "Other operators doing [X] have seen [Y]..."

### Proposal (5 min)

**Goal:** Present terms confidently

**Present:**

- Renewal terms (same, adjusted, or multi-year option)
- Any expansion recommendations
- Timeline for signature

**Say:**

- "Based on everything, I recommend [terms]. Here's why..."
- "Multi-year would lock in your rate and give you [benefit]."
- "Any concerns with these terms?"

## Renewal Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Healthy Customer, Standard Renewal

**Approach:** Celebratory, forward-looking

**Conversation:**

1. Celebrate wins
2. Light touch on concerns
3. Present same terms or multi-year
4. Easy close

**Expansion opportunity:** Yes — plant seeds or propose

### Scenario 2: Healthy Customer, Expansion Opportunity

**Approach:** Strategic, value-driven upsell

**Conversation:**

1. Review value (build case)
2. Connect their goals to expansion
3. Present renewal + expansion
4. Bundle pricing if helpful

**Key:** Don't separate renewal and expansion — bundle

### Scenario 3: At-Risk Customer, Want to Retain

**Approach:** Problem-solving, flexible

**Conversation:**

1. Acknowledge concerns directly
2. Present plan to address
3. Consider concessions if warranted
4. Get commitment to stay

**Concession options:**

- Price discount (last resort)
- Free training/onboarding
- Feature pilot access
- Contract flexibility

### Scenario 4: Price Pushback

**Approach:** Value defense, ROI focus

**Conversation:**

1. Acknowledge budget pressure
2. Review ROI (specific to them)
3. Compare to cost of switching
4. Consider term adjustment vs. price cut

**Say:**

- "I understand budget's tight. Let's look at what you're getting for that investment..."
- "Switching would cost you [onboarding time, learning curve, data migration]. Is that worth saving $X?"
- "Would a shorter term at current rate work better than a discount?"

### Scenario 5: Competitor Evaluation

**Approach:** Confident, differentiation-focused

**Conversation:**

1. Acknowledge they're evaluating (don't be defensive)
2. Ask what they're looking for
3. Differentiate on what matters to them
4. Highlight switching costs
5. Offer to match if warranted

**Say:**

- "Happy to talk through what you're seeing from [competitor]. What's appealing?"
- "One thing to consider: you've got [X history, Y integrations, Z trained staff]. That doesn't transfer."
- "What would need to be true for you to stay?"

## Renewal Objection Handling

### "We need a lower price"

**Response:**

> "I hear you on budget. Let me ask — is the issue the total cost, or is it that you're not sure you're getting the value? Because if we look at [specific savings], you're getting $X back for every $Y you spend."

**If still pushing:**

> "What if we looked at a different term structure instead of a price cut? Or is there a feature you're not using that we could help you adopt to increase value?"

### "We're evaluating other options"

**Response:**

> "That makes sense — you should make sure you're with the right partner. What are you hoping the other options offer? I'd like to understand what's missing for you."

**Follow up:**

> "Keep in mind — you've got [specific data, trained team, integrations]. That's months of work that doesn't transfer. Let's make sure you're comparing apples to apples."

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**

> "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think through? I want to make sure you have what you need to decide."

**If stalling:**

> "Is there a concern you haven't mentioned? I'd rather address it now than have it linger."

### "The product isn't where we need it"

**Response:**

> "I appreciate you being direct. Tell me specifically what's not working — is it a feature gap, a performance issue, or something else?"

**Follow up:**

> "Let me take that back to the team. Can we schedule a follow-up in a week so I can share what's possible?"
