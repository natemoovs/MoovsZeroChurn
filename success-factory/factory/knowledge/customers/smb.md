## What Success Looks Like

### Healthy SMB Customer

- **Growing fleet** — Added at least 1 vehicle since onboarding
- **Upgraded from free** — On Standard or Pro plan
- **Online booking live** — Customers booking through portal
- **Payments through Moovs** — Not manually collecting
- **Referring others** — Word-of-mouth promoter

### Key Success Metrics

## Churn Reasons by Root Cause

### 1. Never Got to Value (45% of SMB churn)

- Setup incomplete
- Didn't understand key features
- Expected something different
- Too busy to learn

**Prevention:** Stronger onboarding, early health checks

### 2. Business Didn't Grow (25%)

- Owner stayed part-time
- Market conditions
- Decided not to scale

**Prevention:** Hard to prevent, but don't invest heavily

### 3. Found It Too Simple (15%)

- Outgrew SMB features
- Needed enterprise capabilities
- Grew into Mid-Market

**Prevention:** Upgrade path conversation before they look elsewhere

### 4. Price Sensitivity (15%)

- Couldn't afford even Standard
- Stayed on free, then left
- Found cheaper alternative

**Prevention:** ROI conversation, free-to-paid timing

## Expansion Triggers

### When to Suggest Upgrade

| Trigger | From | To | Why Now |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Adding 4th vehicle | Free | Standard | Need unlimited vehicles |
| Hiring first employee | Standard | Pro | Need more users |
| Won corporate account | Pro | Pro + CRM | Need email automation |
| Opening online booking | Any | Ensure Portal setup | Revenue opportunity |

### Expansion Conversation Starters

**Adding vehicles:**
> "Congrats on the new van! You're at 3 vehicles now — Standard gives you unlimited. Want me to walk through the upgrade?"

**Hiring:**
> "I see you added a dispatcher. Pro gives you 5 users so they can have their own login. Makes training easier too."

**Corporate account:**
> "Landing that corporate contract is huge. They'll expect professional invoicing — let's make sure that's set up."

### What NOT to Push

- AI features (overkill for SMB)
- Enterprise modules (wrong tier)
- Shuttle platform (different business)
- Features they haven't asked about

## Talking to SMB Customers

### Effective Approaches

- **Be efficient** — They're busy running everything
- **Lead with time savings** — Their scarcest resource
- **Show their data** — They often don't know their own metrics
- **Use peer examples** — "Other small operators do X"
- **Keep it simple** — Don't overwhelm with features

### Language That Works

- "This will save you 2 hours a week"
- "Your customers can book online 24/7"
- "Other operators your size do [X]"
- "Here's how to grow to 5 vehicles"
- "Let's get you looking professional"

### Language to Avoid

- "Enterprise-grade features"
- "AI-powered automation"
- "Complex integrations"
- "Custom implementation"
- "Strategic account planning"

## SMB Customer Personas

### The Grinder (Most Common)

- Works 60+ hours
- Handles everything personally
- Wants time back
- Risk: Burnout leads to business closure

**CSM approach:** Focus ruthlessly on time savings

### The Aspirer

- Has growth mindset
- Wants to scale up
- Watching bigger operators
- Risk: Outgrows you if not upgraded

**CSM approach:** Connect features to growth goals

### The Lifestyle Operator

- Part-time intentionally
- Doesn't want complexity
- Low usage is fine
- Risk: Not much churn risk, but low expansion

**CSM approach:** Light touch, don't over-engage
