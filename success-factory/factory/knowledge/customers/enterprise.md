## Churn Reasons by Root Cause

### 1. Organizational Change (40% of Enterprise churn)

- New leadership with different vendor relationships
- M&A — acquired company has different platform
- Champion left, replacement chose competitor
- Strategic direction shift

**Prevention:** Multi-thread at executive level, make switching cost clear, be embedded in operations

### 2. Platform Gaps (30%)

- Missing critical capability
- Integration not available
- Competitor launched feature we don't have
- Customization requests unfulfilled

**Prevention:** Product partnership, custom solutions, set expectations early

### 3. Service Failures (20%)

- Migration problems not resolved
- Downtime during critical period
- Support quality decline
- Promises not kept

**Prevention:** Deliver flawlessly, over-communicate, own issues fast

### 4. Budget/ROI (10%)

- Failed to prove ROI
- Budget cuts forced consolidation
- Cheaper competitor (rare at Enterprise)

**Prevention:** Document ROI quarterly, tie to business outcomes, executive visibility

## Expansion Triggers

### When to Suggest Expansion

| Trigger                              | Expansion           | Why Now                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Manual scheduling still taking hours | AI Scheduler        | 3-4 hours → 15 minutes |
| Processing manifests manually        | AI Import           | Automate intake        |
| Missed calls/after-hours             | AI Contact Center   | 24/7 coverage          |
| Corporate clients want reports       | Moovs Insights      | One-click reporting    |
| Opening new market                   | Additional location | Multi-location support |
| Shuttle contract won                 | Shuttle Platform    | New capability         |

### Enterprise Expansion Playbook

**Do:**

- Connect expansion to business goals they've stated
- Use their own data to show need
- Pilot before full rollout
- Executive sponsorship for new modules

**Don't:**

- Push multiple expansions at once
- Surprise them with big invoices
- Sell features they haven't asked about
- Ignore their actual priorities

### Expansion Conversation Starters

**AI Scheduler:**

> "You mentioned dispatch still takes 3 hours for your 150 daily trips. Roberts Hawaii cut that to 15 minutes with AI Scheduler. Want to pilot it with one dispatch team?"

**AI Import:**

> "I know those airline manifests are killing your team. AI Import can read them automatically. One operator saved 10 hours a week. Want to try it with one corporate account?"

**New Location:**

> "Congrats on the San Francisco expansion. We can set up a separate location view so your local team has their own dashboard while you see the full picture."

## Stakeholder Management

### Key Stakeholders to Engage

| Role             | Priority          | Engagement        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| CEO/Owner        | Executive Sponsor | Quarterly touch   |
| COO/Ops Director | Champion          | Weekly/bi-weekly  |
| Dispatch Manager | Power User        | As needed         |
| CFO/Finance      | Economic Buyer    | Renewal, ROI      |
| IT/Technical     | Integration Owner | As needed         |
| Drivers          | End Users         | Adoption tracking |

### Multi-Threading Strategy

- Never rely on single champion
- Build relationships at multiple levels
- Document value for different stakeholders
- Include executives in QBRs
- Create operational dependency (not just relationship)

## Talking to Enterprise Customers

### Effective Approaches

- **Lead with business impact** — Not features, outcomes
- **Use their metrics** — Their data, their language
- **Think strategically** — Where's the business going
- **Be a partner** — Not a vendor
- **Executive-ready** — Can present to C-suite

### Language That Works

- "Consolidate your operations into one source of truth"
- "Your dispatch time went from 4 hours to 45 minutes"
- "Here's the ROI we delivered this quarter: $[X]"
- "Based on your growth plans, here's what we recommend"
- "Let me connect you with Roberts Hawaii — similar scale, similar challenges"

### Language to Avoid

- "Small business" or "starter" anything
- "Self-service" or "DIY"
- "Basic features"
- Generic value propositions
- Anything that sounds like SMB messaging
