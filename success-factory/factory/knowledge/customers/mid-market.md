## Churn Reasons by Root Cause

### 1. Champion Departure (35% of Mid-Market churn)

- Ops Manager who loved Moovs leaves
- New person has different preference
- Knowledge of value walks out door

**Prevention:** Multi-thread relationships, document value, onboard new stakeholders

### 2. Outgrew Mid-Market Needs (25%)

- Hit 20+ vehicles, needed Enterprise
- Wanted AI features
- Required integrations we didn't have

**Prevention:** Proactive Enterprise conversation before they look elsewhere

### 3. Growth Stalled (20%)

- Business didn't scale as planned
- Market conditions changed
- Cost-cutting pressures

**Prevention:** Connect Moovs to growth opportunities, prove ROI

### 4. Feature Gaps (20%)

- Missing capability they needed
- Competitor had something we didn't
- Requests went unanswered

**Prevention:** Product feedback loop, set expectations, find workarounds

## Expansion Triggers

### When to Suggest Upgrade

| Trigger                   | From | To             | Why Now                |
| ------------------------- | ---- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Hitting 20 vehicles       | Pro  | Enterprise     | AI Scheduler value     |
| Won corporate contract    | Pro  | Pro + Insights | Reporting requirements |
| Opening 2nd location      | Pro  | Enterprise     | Multi-location needs   |
| Affiliate network growing | Pro  | Enterprise     | Farm-out management    |
| Manually importing trips  | Any  | AI Import      | Time savings           |

### Expansion Conversation Starters

**Fleet growth:**

> "You're at 18 vehicles now — when you hit 20, the AI Scheduler starts making a real difference. Operators save 3-4 hours daily on dispatch. Want to see it?"

**Corporate accounts:**

> "That new corporate contract is going to want reporting. Moovs Insights would let you generate those with one click instead of hours in spreadsheets."

**Efficiency pain:**

> "You mentioned spending 2 hours on trip imports every week. AI Import reads those manifests automatically. Most Mid-Market operators make this their first Enterprise add-on."

### What NOT to Push Too Early

- Full Enterprise package (price shock)
- Features they haven't expressed need for
- Shuttle platform (unless they ask)
- Multiple add-ons at once

## Talking to Mid-Market Customers

### Effective Approaches

- **Lead with efficiency** — Time and cost savings
- **Speak to scale** — How to grow without proportional chaos
- **Use their data** — Show them their own metrics
- **Reference peers** — Other 10-15 vehicle operators
- **Plan forward** — Where are they going, how Moovs helps

### Language That Works

- "Scale without adding headcount"
- "Dispatch 15 vehicles in 20 minutes instead of 2 hours"
- "Your drivers adopted the app 94% — that's above average"
- "Ready to talk about what 25 vehicles looks like?"
- "Let's look at your busiest month — here's what's possible"

### Language to Avoid

- "Small business features"
- "Basic functionality"
- "You're not big enough for..."
- "Maybe later when you grow"
- Treating them like SMB
