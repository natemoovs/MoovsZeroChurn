## Features That Drive Retention

### Tier 1: "Can't Leave Without Pain"

These features create operational dependency. Once adopted, switching cost is high.

| Feature                      | Why Sticky                    | Adoption Priority |

| **Driver App**               | Drivers trained on it         | Week 3            |
| **CRM/Contact History**      | Data accumulates              | Month 1           |
| **Automated Communications** | Customers expect it           | Month 1           |

### Tier 2: "Would Miss Significantly"

| **Affiliate Network** | Revenue opportunity      | If applicable     |

### Tier 3: "Nice to Have"

Differentiators but not switching barriers.

## Common Underutilized Features

These features have high value but low adoption. Push these during health reviews.

### 1. Automated Quoting (40% underutilized)

**What it does:** Instant quotes to customers based on rate configuration

**Why underutilized:**

- Setup seems complex
- Fear of wrong pricing
- Legacy habit of manual quoting

**CSM talking point:**

> "You're still quoting manually — that takes you 10 minutes per quote. With automated quoting, customers get instant pricing. Operators who switch see 30% faster booking conversion."

**Adoption path:**

1. Review rate setup
2. Enable for simple routes first
3. Monitor and adjust
4. Expand to all services

### 2. Customer Portal (35% underutilized)

**What it does:** Self-service booking for repeat customers

**Why underutilized:**

- Didn't promote to customers
- Customers still calling
- Portal not customized

**CSM talking point:**

> "Your customers are still calling to book. That's costing you 5-10 minutes per booking. Your customer portal is ready — let's get your repeat customers using it."

**Adoption path:**

1. Customize portal branding
2. Send to top 10 repeat customers
3. Include link in confirmations
4. Monitor portal vs. phone ratio

### 3. Driver App Full Features (30% underutilized)

**What it does:** Beyond basic — navigation, status updates, earnings

**Why underutilized:**

- Drivers only use for assignments
- Training was minimal
- Older drivers resistant

**CSM talking point:**

> "Your drivers are only using 40% of the app. The navigation and status features save dispatch 10+ calls per day. Let me send you the driver training video."

**Adoption path:**

1. Identify driver adoption %
2. Targeted training for laggards
3. Show drivers their earnings
4. Celebrate high adopters

### 4. Automated SMS/Email (25% underutilized)

**What it does:** Booking confirmations, reminders, driver details

**Why underutilized:**

- Didn't configure messages
- Sending manually instead
- Didn't know it existed

**CSM talking point:**

> "You're still manually texting confirmations. Moovs can send them automatically — booking confirmation, day-before reminder, driver details, everything. Your passengers expect this."

**Adoption path:**

1. Review communication settings
2. Enable key automations
3. Customize messaging
4. Monitor delivery rates

### 5. Payment Links (30% underutilized)

**What it does:** Send payment request links for deposits and balances

**Why underutilized:**

- Collecting cash/check
- Using separate payment tools
- Didn't know it was built in

**CSM talking point:**

> "You mentioned chasing payments takes hours. Payment links let you text a customer and they pay in 30 seconds. Collection time drops from days to hours."

**Adoption path:**

1. Show payment link feature
2. Use for next deposit
3. Track collection time
4. Expand to all payments

### Flight Tracking

- **Stickiness:** Operational reliability

### Affiliate Network (GNET)

- **Stickiness:** Partner relationships
- **Data locked in:** Partner connections, pricing
