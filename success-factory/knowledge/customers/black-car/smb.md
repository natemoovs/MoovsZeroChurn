## Segment Definition

### What SMB Black Car Means

SMB Black Car operators are small, owner-operated transportation businesses generating $50K-$250K in annual revenue, typically running fleets of 1-5 vehicles where the owner is deeply involved in day-to-day operations. These are typically sole proprietors or very small teams focused on delivering reliable service while building their business.

**Revenue Profile:**
- Annual Revenue: $50K-$250K (primary indicator)
- Fleet Size: Typically 1-5 vehicles (but revenue matters more)
- Business Stage: Building foundation, seeking growth
- Operator Type: Owner-operator model

**Key Principle:** Revenue is the primary segmentation indicator. An operator with 8 vehicles generating $150K is SMB. An operator with 3 luxury vehicles generating $400K is Mid-Market.

**Service Types:**
- Primarily black car services (sedans, SUVs) - 75%
- Limousine and specialty vehicles - 20%
- Airport transfers and local transportation
- Individual customer bookings (retail model)
- Small corporate relationships or travel agency partnerships

**Critical Distinction:** Customers book and pay for the ENTIRE vehicle (not per-seat). This is fundamentally different from shuttle operations.

## Firmographic Profile

### Company Size & Scale

**Revenue (Primary Indicator):**
- Minimum: $50K annually (part-time or starting out)
- Sweet Spot: $125K annually
- Maximum: $250K annually
- Threshold: Above $250K typically transitions to Mid-Market
- Rule: If revenue conflicts with fleet size, revenue determines segment

**Fleet Size (Supporting Indicator):**
- Minimum: 1 vehicle (owner-driver)
- Sweet Spot: 3 vehicles
- Maximum: 5 vehicles
- Note: Some operators may have 6-8 vehicles but <$250K revenue → Still SMB

**Staff Structure:**
- Owner: Handles everything - dispatch, sales, operations, admin
- Drivers: Up to 9 employed or contracted drivers (often 2-5)
- Support: No dedicated staff - owner wears all hats
- IT/Tech: None - owner handles all technology decisions

### Business Lifecycle Stage

**Typical Stages:**
- Stage 1: Solo owner-driver (1 vehicle)
- Stage 2: Owner + 1-2 other drivers (2-3 vehicles)
- Stage 3: Growing team (3-5 vehicles, up to 10 drivers)
- Aspiration: Eventually become Mid-Market (6-10+ vehicles)

**Years in Business:**
- New: 0-2 years (just starting out)
- Established: 3-5 years (proven model)
- Mature: 5+ years (stable small business)

### Geographic & Market Characteristics

- Primary: Single location (owner's home office or small office)
- Market Type: Urban, suburban, or smaller markets
- Service Area: Local (typically 30-50 mile radius)
- Expansion: Not typically thinking about multiple locations yet

**Market Position:**
- Building local reputation (word-of-mouth critical)
- Often competes on price and personal service
- Not the luxury/premium tier (more accessible)
- May be part-time initially, transitioning to full-time

### Moovs Product Usage (Current Customers)

| Plan | % of SMB |
|------|----------|

## Technographic Profile

### Current Technology Stack

**Dispatch & Operations:**
- Common tools: Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, pen and paper
- Legacy software: May use very basic dispatch software
- Problem: No unified system - cobbled together free tools
- Gap: Everything is manual and disconnected

**Booking & Customer-Facing:**
- Phone as primary booking method
- Email for quotes and confirmations
- Basic website or Facebook page (if any online presence)
- No online booking capability (typically)

**Operations & Management:**
- Manual driver assignment (phone calls, texts)
- Calendar-based scheduling
- No fleet tracking or GPS
- No reporting - rough sense of business from bank account

### Technology Needs & Readiness

**Must-Have Capabilities:**
1. Simple dispatch (easy to learn and use)
2. Look professional to customers (basic online booking, confirmations)
3. Affordable pricing (budget constraints)
4. Mobile-friendly (owner works from phone)
5. Minimal setup complexity (DIY-friendly)

**Technology Posture:**

## Pain Points & Problems

### 1. Everything is Manual (Primary Pain)

- **Pain:** Owner does everything manually - answering phones, quoting, scheduling, dispatching, billing
- **Impact:** Owner is overwhelmed and exhausted; can't grow because at capacity
- **Language:** "I'm working 70 hours a week doing everything manually. If I get one more customer, I won't be able to handle it."
- **Urgency:** High - owner burnout is real

### 2. Looking Unprofessional to Customers

- **Pain:** No online booking, manual text confirmations, homemade email quotes
- **Impact:** Losing customers to competitors who look more established
- **Language:** "Customers expect to book online and get automatic confirmations. When I tell them to call me, they sometimes just book with someone else."
- **Competitive Pressure:** Losing business due to perceived unprofessionalism

### 3. Can't Grow Beyond Current Capacity

- **Pain:** Business growth limited by owner's time and manual processes
- **Impact:** Turning down business or providing poor service during busy times
- **Language:** "I could probably double my business if I had systems in place. Right now, I'm maxed out just handling what I have."
- **Strategic:** Hitting ceiling on growth potential

### 4. No Visibility into Business Performance

- **Pain:** No idea which customers are most valuable, which days are busiest, what revenue trends are
- **Impact:** Making decisions based on gut feel, missing opportunities
- **Language:** "I have a rough sense of how I'm doing from my bank account, but I don't really know what's working and what's not."
- **Growth Blocker:** Can't optimize without data

### 5. Tracking Customer Information is Chaos

- **Pain:** Customer contacts, history, preferences scattered across phone, email, memory, messy spreadsheets
- **Impact:** Can't provide personalized service, miss follow-up opportunities
- **Language:** "I know I have repeat customers, but I can't keep track of who they are or when they last booked."
- **Revenue Impact:** Missing repeat business and referrals

### 6. Driver Coordination is All Phone Calls and Texts

- **Pain:** Coordinating with drivers requires constant phone calls, texts, confusion
- **Impact:** Miscommunication, missed trips, driver frustration
- **Language:** "I'm texting my drivers all day. Sometimes messages get missed. It's chaos."

### 7. Quoting Takes Too Long

- **Pain:** Creating quotes manually, sending via email, waiting for response
- **Impact:** Slow response times lose business to faster competitors
- **Language:** "By the time I get a quote back to someone, they've already booked elsewhere."

### 8. Can't Afford Enterprise Software

- **Pain:** Big dispatch platforms cost too much and are too complex
- **Impact:** Stuck with manual processes because professional tools are out of reach
- **Language:** "I looked at dispatch software before, but it's all built for big companies. I can't afford $1,000/month."
- **Market Gap:** No affordable professional solution

### 9. Payment and Billing is a Mess

- **Pain:** Tracking payments, invoicing, dealing with late payments is manual
- **Impact:** Cash flow issues, administrative burden
- **Language:** "I spend hours every week chasing payments and sending invoices."

### 10. No Time to Market or Build Reputation

- **Pain:** So busy with operations that there's no time for marketing
- **Impact:** Relying on word-of-mouth alone, not growing as fast as possible
- **Language:** "I know I should be marketing online, but I don't have time. I'm just trying to keep up with operations."

## Buying Process & Decision Criteria

### Buying Committee

**Primary Decision Maker:**
- Role: Owner (sole decision maker)
- Concerns: Affordability, ease of use, time savings
- Authority: Complete authority (no approval needed)
- Mindset: "Will this make my life easier without breaking the bank?"

**Key Influencers:**
- Other Drivers: If they have employees, drivers' opinions matter
- Spouse/Family: For very small operators, family may weigh in
- Peer Operators: Recommendations from other small operator friends

**Unique Dynamic:** This is a solo decision. No committees, no approval process. Owner decides, owner signs up, owner implements. Very fast if convinced.

### Typical Buying Triggers

**Operational Triggers:**
- Owner is completely overwhelmed and burnt out
- Lost a customer due to looking unprofessional
- Embarrassing mistake (double-booking, missed trip)
- Trying to add 2nd or 3rd vehicle and current process won't scale
- Driver quit due to poor communication

**Growth Triggers:**
- Business is growing and owner can't keep up
- Want to take on more business but lack capacity
- Trying to transition from part-time to full-time
- Looking to hire first employee driver

**Competitive Triggers:**
- Competitor has professional website and online booking
- Losing customers who say "I booked with [competitor] because I could book online"
- Seeing other small operators using better tools

### Decision Criteria (Ranked by Importance)

1. **Affordability (Highest Priority)**
   - "Can I afford this with my current revenue?"
   - "Is there a free trial or free plan to start?"
   - "What's the ROI - will I make this money back?"

2. **Ease of Use & Simplicity**
   - "Can I set this up myself without tech help?"
   - "Will I be able to figure this out quickly?"
   - "Is it simple enough that I won't get overwhelmed?"

3. **Looking Professional**
   - "Will this make me look like a real, professional company?"
   - "Can customers book online easily?"
   - "Will I get automated confirmations and reminders?"

4. **Time Savings**
   - "How much time will this save me every day?"
   - "Will I be able to handle more trips without working more hours?"

5. **Growth Enablement**
   - "Will this let me add more vehicles?"
   - "Can I grow without switching tools later?"

6. **Support & Help**
   - "If I get stuck, can I get help?"
   - "Are there videos or guides to help me learn?"

7. **Mobile-Friendly**
   - "Can I manage everything from my phone?"

### Sales Cycle Characteristics

**Cycle Length:** 30 days (4 weeks) - can be faster

**Typical Timeline:**
- Week 1: Discovery (saw ad, heard about Moovs, researching)
- Week 2: Sign up for free trial or free plan, test it out
- Week 3: Decision to upgrade to paid plan (if convinced)
- Week 4: Implementation and setup (self-guided)

**Sales Motion:** PLG (Product-Led Growth) with support
- Primarily self-serve (sign up online, try it out)
- Support available when needed (chat, email, videos)
- Low-touch sales assist if they have questions
- Success = user adopts product through own experience

### Budget Authority & Deal Size

**Budget Range:**
- Annual Software Budget: $1,800-$3,000 ($150-$250/month)
- Sweet Spot: $200/month (Standard plan range)
- Free Plan Usage: ~45% start with free plan

**ROI Calculation They Care About:**
- Time saved per week (hours × $20-40/hour equivalent)
- Additional trips they can handle (revenue opportunity)
- Customers they won't lose (retention value)
- Key metric: "Will I make this money back within 2-3 months?"

---

## Disqualifiers (DO NOT PURSUE)

**Hard Disqualifiers:**
- Not actually operating (just thinking about starting)
- Only doing farm-in/affiliate work (no direct customers)
- Part-time hobby operation with no growth intent
- Wants completely custom/DIY solution
- Expects white-glove enterprise service at SMB price
- Shuttle or per-seat operators (wrong segment → Shuttle ICP)
- Revenue above $250K (Mid-Market segment)

**Edge Cases - When to Qualify as SMB:**
- 8 vehicles, $180K revenue → SMB (revenue determines segment)
- 3 luxury vehicles, $400K revenue → Mid-Market (revenue trumps fleet)
- 20 vehicles, $200K revenue → SMB (low revenue = budget constraints)

**Rule:** If annual revenue is under $250K, they're SMB regardless of fleet size.

> "Our average operator sets up Moovs in under 30 minutes, and you don't need any tech skills. We have video guides for every step."

> "That's exactly when you need it most - so you can grow. Every operator with 5+ vehicles started where you are. The ones who grew used tools like this."

**"I'll just use spreadsheets and Google Calendar."**
> "You can, but then you won't have online booking, automated confirmations, or customer management. That's how you lose business to competitors who look more professional."

**"What if I outgrow this?"**
> "Moovs scales from 1 vehicle to 50+ vehicles. You won't need to switch platforms as you grow."
