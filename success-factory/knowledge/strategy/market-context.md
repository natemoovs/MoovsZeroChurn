## Market Overview

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Segment              | Market Size             | Moovs Focus |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Black Car & Limo     | ~15,000 operators in US | Primary     |
| Shuttle & Transit    | ~8,000 programs in US   | Primary     |
| NEMT                 | ~12,000 providers in US | Secondary   |
| Charter & Motorcoach | ~4,000 operators in US  | Secondary   |

### Revenue Composition Philosophy

Moovs revenue is segmented across two platform categories and multiple tiers:

**Black Car Platform** (private vehicle bookings)

- SMB: $50K-$250K operator revenue
- Mid-Market: $250K-$1M operator revenue
- Enterprise: $1M+ operator revenue

**Shuttle Platform** (per-seat/program bookings)

- University programs
- Corporate programs
- Third-party operators

**Key Principle:** Revenue determines segment, not fleet size. A 15-coach operator at $1.5M revenue is Enterprise. A 25-sedan operator at $800K is Mid-Market.

## Segmentation Philosophy

### Revenue-First Approach

Fleet size is a supporting indicator, but **operator revenue is the primary determinant** of segment and sales motion:

| Revenue    | Segment    | Sales Motion          |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| $50K-$250K | SMB        | PLG / Self-serve      |
| $250K-$1M  | Mid-Market | Sales-assisted        |
| $1M+       | Enterprise | High-touch enterprise |

### Platform Distinction

The foundational question for any prospect:

> "Do passengers book the entire vehicle or individual seats?"

- **Entire vehicle** → Black Car Platform
- **Individual seats** → Shuttle Platform

This distinction drives everything: product fit, messaging, pain points, and sales approach.

## GTM Principles

### 1. Lead with Problems, Not Features

Understand the operator's pain before presenting solutions. The same product capability solves different problems for different segments.

### 2. Segment-Appropriate Language

| Segment    | Language Style                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| SMB        | Simple, direct, DIY-friendly            |
| Mid-Market | Growth-focused, efficiency              |
| Enterprise | Consolidation, reliability, partnership |
| University | Student experience, safety              |
| Corporate  | Retention, ROI, sustainability          |
| Operator   | Win contracts, margins, efficiency      |

### 3. Revenue-First Qualification

Always qualify by revenue first, fleet size second. This prevents mis-segmentation and ensures appropriate sales motion.

### 4. Proof Points by Segment

Use case studies and references from similar operators:

- SMB → other growing small operators
- Mid-Market → operators who scaled successfully
- Enterprise → large, complex operations
- University → peer institutions
- Corporate → companies in similar industries
- Operator → multi-contract shuttle providers

## Messaging Guardrails

### Universal Don'ts

- Never use "game-changing," "revolutionary," or similar hyperbole
- Never lead with features over problems
- Never use shuttle language for black car (or vice versa)
- Never promise DIY for enterprise or white-glove for SMB
- Never ignore segment-specific compliance concerns

### Segment-Specific Guidelines

Detailed messaging guidance lives in each ICP document:

- [Black Car SMB](../customers/black-car/smb.md)
- [Black Car Mid-Market](../customers/black-car/mid-market.md)
- [Black Car Enterprise](../customers/black-car/enterprise.md)
- [Shuttle Base](../customers/shuttle/base.md)
- [Shuttle University](../customers/shuttle/university.md)
- [Shuttle Corporate](../customers/shuttle/corporate.md)
- [Shuttle Operator](../customers/shuttle/operator.md)

## Content Creation Workflow

When creating marketing, sales, or GTM content:

1. **Identify the segment** using the decision tree in [ICP Overview](../customers/overview.md)
2. **Read the relevant ICP** for pain points, language, and messaging guidelines
3. **Check the Quick Reference** section for rapid context
4. **Use proof points** appropriate to the segment
5. **Validate language** against the do's and don'ts
