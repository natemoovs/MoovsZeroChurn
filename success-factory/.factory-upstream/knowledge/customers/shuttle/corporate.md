## Corporate-Specific Pain Points

### 1. Retention & Recruitment Impact

- **Pain:** Commute is cited in exit interviews; candidates decline offers due to commute
- **Impact:** High turnover costs, difficulty hiring top talent
- **Language:** "We lose 3-4 engineers a year who cite commute. That's $500K in recruiting and training costs."

### 2. Inability to Prove Program ROI

- **Pain:** CFO questions shuttle program value; no data to justify budget
- **Impact:** Budget cuts, service reductions, program cancellation threats
- **Language:** "Leadership asks 'Why do we spend $1M on shuttles?' and I can't give them real numbers."

### 3. Hybrid Work Demand Chaos

- **Pain:** Unpredictable ridership with hybrid schedules; some days overcrowded, some days empty
- **Impact:** Wasted capacity, poor employee experience, budget inefficiency
- **Language:** "Tuesday and Wednesday are packed, but Monday shuttles run half-empty. We can't plan."

### 4. Parking Pressure & Cost

- **Pain:** Parking is expensive to build/maintain; running out of spaces
- **Impact:** Employee frustration, real estate constraints, sustainability goals
- **Language:** "Building a new parking structure costs $30K per space. We need to get people out of cars."

### 5. Employee Complaints & HR Burden

- **Pain:** HR fields "Where's my shuttle?" calls; employees complain about unreliable service
- **Impact:** HR time wasted, employee dissatisfaction, Glassdoor reviews
- **Language:** "My team spends hours a week answering shuttle questions. We need self-service tracking."

## GTM Motion

### Primary Approach

**Sales-Led with Champion Development:**

- Often starts with Facilities or HR champion who experiences the pain
- Requires building business case for economic buyer
- Demo and pilot are critical for stakeholder buy-in
- Security/IT review is common gate

### Marketing Channels

- HR/People operations conferences (SHRM, HR Tech)
- Corporate real estate events (CoreNet)
- Sustainability/ESG forums
- LinkedIn: HR leaders, Facilities directors, Commute program managers
- Peer referrals (corporate transportation networks)

### Key Sales Activities

**1. Champion Development:**

- Identify frustrated Facilities/HR manager
- Provide ROI calculator and business case templates
- Arm champion with peer company examples

**2. Demo Strategy:**

- Show employee-facing app first (employee experience is #1)
- Demonstrate reservation and capacity management
- Walk through ROI dashboards and reporting
- Address IT/security requirements early

**3. Pilot Program:**

- Start with one route or one building
- Run for 30-60 days
- Gather employee feedback actively
- Present pilot results with ridership and satisfaction data

### Typical Objections & Responses

**"Our employees won't download another app."**

> "Companies see 70%+ adoption in first month with proper launch. We provide employee communication templates and launch support. Plus, SSO means no new password to remember."

**"We can't justify the cost right now."**

> "Let's calculate your cost-per-parking-space vs. cost-per-shuttle-ride. Most companies find shuttles are 3-4x more cost-effective. And that's before retention savings."

**"Hybrid work makes demand unpredictable."**

> "That's exactly why you need reservations and real-time capacity data. You can right-size your fleet based on actual demand, not guesses."

**"Our IT team won't approve another vendor."**

> "We integrate with SSO and meet SOC 2 requirements. We're happy to do a security review with your IT team."
