[First Name],

[Case Study Company] runs a 15-vehicle operation in [City] - mostly airport runs and corporate accounts.

Before switching to Moovs, they were spending 3+ hours daily on:

- Manually confirming every booking by phone
- Texting drivers trip details
- Chasing payments from corporate accounts

Now their confirmations go out automatically, drivers get trips in an app, and cards get charged the day of service.

They're not doing less business - they're just not drowning in admin.

I put together a quick case study if you want to see the specifics: [Link]

Or if you'd rather just talk through whether this makes sense for [Company], I'm around this week.

[Your name]
