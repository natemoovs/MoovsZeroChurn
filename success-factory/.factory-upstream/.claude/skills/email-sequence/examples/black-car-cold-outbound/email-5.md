[First Name],

I've reached out a few times about Moovs - I'll assume the timing isn't right or this isn't a priority.

No worries at all. I'll stop the emails.

If things change down the road - you're scaling up, fed up with your current setup, or just curious - feel free to reach out. I'm not going anywhere.

Best of luck with [Company].

[Your name]
