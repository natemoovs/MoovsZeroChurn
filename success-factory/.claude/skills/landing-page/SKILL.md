## 1. Hero Section

The hero makes or breaks conversion. Be clear, not clever.

### Headline Formula

**[What you do] + [for who] + [key benefit]**

**Examples**:

- "All-in-One Software for Transportation Businesses"
- "The Modern Platform That Grows With Your Fleet"
- "Run Your Transportation Business From One Place"

### Subheadline

Expand on the headline with a specific pain point or benefit.

**Examples**:

- "Manage bookings, dispatch, payments, and marketing—without the chaos."
- "From 3 vehicles to 500+, Moovs scales with you while staying simple."
- "Stop juggling spreadsheets. Start growing your business."

### Primary CTA

One clear action. Use action-oriented, benefit-focused language.

**Use**:

- "Book a Demo"
- "Start Free Trial"
- "See It in Action"

**Avoid**:

- "Learn More" (too vague)
- "Submit" (too generic)
- Multiple competing CTAs

### Hero Visual

- Product screenshot showing the main dashboard or booking interface
- Short demo video (under 60 seconds)
- Avoid generic stock photos—show the actual product

---

## 2. Social Proof Bar

Place immediately after or within the hero section to build instant credibility.

### Elements to Include

- **Customer count**: "Trusted by 1,000+ transportation businesses"
- **Review ratings**: "4.9 stars on Capterra" with badge
- **Awards**: Capterra Shortlist 2025, GetApp Category Leader 2025
- **Satisfaction stat**: "96% User Satisfaction Rating"

### Customer Logos (if available)

Display 4-6 recognizable customer logos in a horizontal row.

---

## 3. Problem/Pain Section

Make visitors feel understood before pitching the solution.

### Headline Examples

- "Sound Familiar?"
- "Running a Transportation Business Is Hard"
- "Tired of Software That Slows You Down?"

### Pain Points to Address

Reference the target segment's ICP for specific pain points. Common ones:

- Juggling multiple systems (spreadsheets, phone, calendar, payment processor)
- Double-bookings and scheduling chaos
- No visibility into driver locations
- Manual dispatching eating up hours
- Outdated software that's clunky and hard to use
- Poor customer communication leading to complaints
- No way to grow without hiring more office staff

### Format

Use short, punchy statements or a checklist format:

> ❌ Manually dispatching every trip
> ❌ Chasing drivers for updates
> ❌ Losing bookings to double-entry errors
> ❌ Working IN your business instead of ON it
